## Table of Contents

In order to update the table of contents at the top of the page, you first need to install [markdown-toc](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/markdown-toc), which is a node package.

```
yarn global add markdown-toc
```

After that, you can regenerae the table of contents using the following command, which will edit the file in-place with
the updated terms and conditions.
```
markdown-toc README.md -i
```
